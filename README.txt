This repository has been created for facilitating NLP on Takri. It contains -
All folders which have images of characters are divided into 3 sections, Top Zone (TZ, also called as Uper Zone), Middle Zone and Bittom Zone
Base Images - Approx 14K images
Image Transformations which have images generated using transformations of rotation, scale, sheer etc. This contains 140K images
GAN transformations which have another 71K images. These are created using deep learning pretrained models.

Pre-trained models are trained to generate infinite images. There is a pre-trained model for each character.

Source code is for sample implementation. You may have to make changes to path etc. The purpose of source code is for general guidance of use.
